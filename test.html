    <p>Last night, I felt insanely stressed from work. My to-do list grew exponentially, while my energy was lower with every box I checked. When I got home, I had no brain cells left. So I opened a bottle of wine and unlocked my phone screen.
    
      After years in a relationship, I’m still insanely attracted to Jonathan. Although I don’t think he used these strategies on purpose to impress me, it worked perfectly. However, I think the most effective advice at all is to be authentic. If those tricks don’t feel natural to you, don’t try to force them. It’s always better to let things run their course.</p>
